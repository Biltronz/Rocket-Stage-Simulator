# Rocket Ascent Simulator

A Python script that simulates the vertical ascent of a rocket under gravity and air drag. The simulation accounts for changing mass during fuel burn and plots key parameters like altitude, velocity, acceleration, mass, and drag force over time.

## Features
- Simulates rocket ascent with customizable mass, thrust, burn rate, drag coefficient, and burn time.
- Visualizes altitude, velocity, acceleration, mass, and drag over time.
- Highlights burnout point and terminal velocity.

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
